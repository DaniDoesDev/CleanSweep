# CleanSweep
Agile Group Project - Team Dirt Destroyers!

# Sprint 1

For Sprint 1 we wanted to concentrate on both getting local environments set up, getting everyone successfully connected to the shared GitHub repo, and getting basic Clean Sweep functionality in place. This functionality includes:

* Navigation - Basic Movement
    * Acceptance criteria - Clean sweep is able to move horizontally and vertically one grid space at a time. If it is blocked, it will not move in the direction specified, print out a message indicating this, and return false. Otherwise, it will print out a message that it successfully navigated to the new grid space and return true. 
* Navigation - Basic Obstacle Detection
* Basic Dirt Detection
* Basic Cleaning
* Basic Floor Type Detection
