# CleanSweep
Agile Group Project - Team Dirt Destroyers!

# Sprint 1

For Sprint 1 we wanted to concentrate on both getting local environments set up, getting everyone successfully connected to the shared GitHub repo, and getting basic Clean Sweep functionality in place. This functionality includes:

* Navigation - Basic Movement
* Basic Dirt Detection
* Basic Cleaning
* Basic Floor Type Detection
