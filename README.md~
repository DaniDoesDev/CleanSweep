# CleanSweep
Agile Group Project - Team Dirt Destroyers!

# Sprint 1

For Sprint 1 we wanted to concentrate on both getting local environments set up, getting everyone successfully connected to the shared GitHub repo, and getting basic Clean Sweep functionality in place. This functionality includes:

* Navigation - Basic Movement
    * Acceptance criteria - Clean sweep is able to move horizontally and vertically one grid space at a time. If it is blocked, it will not move in the direction specified, print out a message indicating this, and return false. Otherwise, it will print out a message that it successfully navigated to the new grid space and return true. 
* Navigation - Basic Obstacle Detection
* Basic Dirt Detection
* Basic Cleaning
* Basic Floor Type Detection

* Main.java: This file creates a new robot by calling `new Robot();`.
* Robot.java: Whenever the robot starts, it turns on its object detection system,
 its floor plan system, adds 5 sensors, turns on its sensor simulator system, and 
 sets its coordinates to (1,1).  
* ObjectDetection.java: Reads the robot's sensors and updates the floor plan.
* FloorPlan.java: Starts with empty Hashmap and has two useful functions: `updateFloorPlan()`
to write any object to floor plan coordinate; and `readFloorPlan()` to read a coordinate.
* Sensor.java: Reads from the sensor simulator. Each sensor has a direction 1-5, 
1-4 = directional and 5 = down. (Todo: add floor type sensor.)
* SensorSimulator.java: Creates a 10 x 10 layout where the first and last
rows and the first and last columns are always walls. The other cells are randomized.
(The robot's starting point is always "clear".)
